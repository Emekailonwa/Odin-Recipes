# Odin-Recipes

My First coding(html) project

The project is about helping people worldwide prepare some African dishes from the comfort of their home. 3 Recipes were selected based on the highly search African dishes metrics from google. Each recipe has got a brief description, ingredients and steps on how to go about preparing them.

I have been able to put to practice knowledge gained from html tutorials (The OdinProject and W3schools), linux commands,communication,organization and git/github skills.
