    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <blockquote>Egusi soup (also known as melon soup) and pounded yam is a mouthwatering and appetizing dish to behold and traditionally eaten by hand (washed hands of course!).
        The egusi soup is often thickened with ground melon seeds. The basic ingredients include assorted meat, dried fish, onions, fresh tomatoes, seasonings & green vegetables.

        <blockquote>
            The pounded yam is made by boiling peeled yam and then pounding it until tender, then you can shape it as desired. Pounding the boiled yam is done by using a mortar and
            pestle which is widely used in Nigeria or any good kitchen mixer. Alternatively, you can use the already processed yam flour which can be bought from any African shop.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tuber of African Yam</li>
        <li>170g ground egusi</li>
        <li>450g shredded pumpkin leaves (Ugu)</li>
        <li>10 pcs of cow skin (Kpomo)</li>
        <li>10 pcs of goat meat</li>
        <li>5 pcs of shaki (beef tripe)</li>
        <li>330g shredded stock fish</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of ground crayfish</li>
        <li>5 fresh yellow peppers</li>
        <li>5 fresh red peppers</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of ground pepper</li>
        <li>¼ tsp opeyi (optional)</li>
        <li>6 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>240mL palm oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly wash goat meat, kpomo and shaki with water. 
            Season with one onion (chopped), three seasoning cubes,
            one tablespoon ground pepper and salt to taste. Add water<br>
            and mix thoroughly. Set on medium heat and cook till tender.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Thoroughly wash stock fish and dry fish — first with hot water
            and afterwards with tap water. You may need to further boil the
            stock fish depending on its toughness; the stock <br> should be
            very tender.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Blend remaining onion, yellow peppers and red peppers with an electric blender.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Place ground egusi in a pot, add blended pepper purée and palm oil. Mix together 
            with 60mL water until a thick batter is formed. Place on low heat and stir fry 
            until the batter <br>
             begins to dry up and the oil bubbles on top, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Stir in the cooked meat and meat stock. Add water as needed to achieve your desired 
            soup consistency.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Next, add seasoning cubes, ground crayfish, shredded dry fish, shredded stock fish, 
            opeyi and salt. Stir thoroughly, and cook for about 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Finally, mix in the pumpkin leaves (ugu), and turn heat off immediately.
        </li>
        <br>
        <p>Note: you can use any meat of your choice to prepare this soup. Just ensure 
           the meat is tender.
